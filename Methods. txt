define methods with parameters
Call methods and their return values
    a method is a special sub-category of functions that must be called on some object. 
    Optional use of parenthesis("Is this a variable, or is this a method?")
    whatever the last line of a method is will be its return value

    def my_method(param)
        puts "Running my method"
        param + 1
    end

Method Arguments
    when we run a method without passing in the required arguments(argument error) it will give us an error message:
    Default arguments
        def say_hi(name = "Rubyist")
            puts "Hi there, #{name}!"
        end

        say_hi
            # => "Hi there, Rubyist!"

        say_hi "Sunny"
            # => "Hi there, Sunny!"

Return values
    Ruby returns a value by default. This returned value will be the value of the last statement:

The return keyword
    to explicitly return what you want returned.
    he return keyword will disrupt the execution of your method, and prevent Ruby from running any lines of code after the return keyword.
