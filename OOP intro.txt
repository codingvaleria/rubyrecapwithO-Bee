What is OOP?
    - based on the concept of objects which contain data in form of attributes and properties and procedures known as methods.
    - its about structuring code so that its functionality can be shared throughout the app
    - makes programs more intuitive to design, faster to develop, more amenable to modification, and easier to understand.

Procedural programming - build programs in sequential order and call methods when you want shared behavior between pages in the application.

Basics
1. Classes and instances
2. The new class method
3. Instance methods
4. Local variables and instance variables
5. Object Attributes

What is an object?
    -  is a thing with all the data and all the logic required to complete a task.

Types of objects
a) Primitive - integer, string, array
b) Non primitive  


Classes
    - identify classes with Caps on name and camel case if they contain two words and class keyword
    - they are blueprints to buikding our objects

        e.g class Dog
                # some code to describe a dog
            end

Instances
    -  Instances refer to the individual objects produced from the class.
    -   Different instances are different objects
    - use the .new method to create instances

The behavior of objects
    - how do we ask this objects to do sth? - dot notation, e.g object-id
    - .methods for defined methods

Instance methods
    - building our own methods i.e instance methods
    - these methods will only be accessible to instances of our class
    e.g class Dog
          # Class body
         # Instance Method Definition
            def bark
                puts "Woof!"
            end
        end
    - cannot be called globally
    - cannot be called without an instance

Instance Variables
    - How do we give objects attributes or properties? i.e instance variables
    - is a variable that is accessible in any instance method in a particular instance of a class.

class Fabric 
def fabric_name(name)
    name = "valeria"
    material_name = name
end

def fabric_origin
    material_name
end

cashmere = Fabric.new
cashmere.fabric_name

end


def square_sum(numbers)
  numbers.map {|n|
    square = n * n
    
  }.sum
  
end
