IO Class
- is a class in Ruby
- is parent to file(for reading files) and sockets(for networks and servers) classes
- provides a common interface(OOP- inheritance) for reading and writing(method) to IO objects
- Works withe file descriptors
- IO objects are based on file descriptors (a mapping between an integer and file name)

File descriptors
- every process has a table that maps open files
- fd (file descriptor)- unique values rep each running process
- every process starts with 3 standard fds- stdin, stdout & stderr


Operations
    open/Close
    read
    write


fd = IO.sysopen('/dev/null', 'w')
=> 5
