- Ruby by default converts inputs to strings

Arrays
-is  a container that holds multiple individual values
-stores different data type
-indexing arrays ; from 0
-

create; 
reading
- range 
friends[0,2]
 => ["Kelvin", "Karen"] 
or 
friends[0...2]
 => ["Kelvin", "Karen"] 

 .sort -only works if contents are of the same data type

 Hashes
 stores multiple pieces with unique key/value pairs

 Methods
 - a block of code to perform a specific task

 Return 
 can return multiple but in array (the array looks vertical though)
 e.g
  def cube (num)
    return num * num *num, 70, 90
  end

  puts cube(3)[2]
    90
Condtion - is a true or false statement

   isfemale = true
   istall = true

   if isfemale 
      puts "you are female"
    else 
      puts "you are female
   end

puts "Enter first number"
num 1 = gets.
